;; Exercise 1.13

;; Got relatively far, but not all the way through the proof
;; Showed the base inductive cases, but then
;; tried to prove fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
;; instead of fib(n+1) = fib(n) + fib(n-1)
;; which probably made it harder

;; Here's a neat write up: http://www.kendyck.com/math/sicp/ex1-13.xml
